# Food List

If you're like me, a day rolls around each week where you think _I don't have any food_, and if it's before 6PM you also think, _I should go get groceries_.

But then begins the turmoil of attempting to compile a grocery list. Because too few items on the list makes the trip less worthwhile - but you also suddenly can't remember any recipes you like.

Once you have recipes, though, the real pain starts - creating a list of shopping items. Again, if you're like me, you open up a generic note-taking app and copy + paste ingredient lists off websites into a checklist. _Maybe_ you take the time to sort items so identical foods are adjacent to one another so you don't scroll halfway down the list to realize you have to go back to produce to get _more spinach_.

This little website is designed to make that last bit painless. You figure your recipes out, that's on you. Once you've got them, though, just copy the list of ingredients and dump it in Food List. Food List takes care of merging foods together and combining the units. Then it gives you a checklist you can reorder as you see fit. Head to the store with confidence that you can make only 1 trip down each aisle.

That's never felt more necessary than at the time of writing, as visiting the grocery has become a far more stressful and time-bound exercise due to pandemic circumstances.

üí• **Plus** - If you install Food List on your homescreen, you can share selected text directly to the app - no need to copy + paste or switch apps.

üéá **And** - It saves your list for you, so you can prep ahead of time and not worry about closing the tab.

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **But** - There's no server, it's just a website. So you can't sync between devices or share with a partner. Working on ideas for that.

## Developing

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
